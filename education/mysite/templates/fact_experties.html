      <p class="card-text m-0"> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted
         by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem
          Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
           'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
            packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search
             for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions 
              evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes 
        on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
